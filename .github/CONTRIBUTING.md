# ReDoc Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to ReDoc. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.

- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines
- Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.
- The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case.

## Pull Request Guidelines
Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from main.
2. Run `npm install` in the repository root.
3. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`). Tip: `npm test -- --watch TestName` is helpful in development.
5. Format your code with prettier (`npm run prettier`).

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) at `v12.0.0+`.

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ npm install # or npm
```

### Commonly used NPM scripts

``` bash
# dev-server, watch and auto reload playground
$ npm start

# start playground app in production environment
$ npm run start:prod

# runt tslint
$ npm run lint

# try autofix tslint issues
$ npm run lint -- --fix

# run unit tests
$ npm run unit

# run e2e tests
$ npm run e2e
# Make sure you have created bundle before running e2e test
# E.g. run `npm run bundle` and wait for the finishing process.

# open cypress UI to debug e2e test
$ npm run cy:open

# run the unit tests (includes linting and license checks)
$ npm test

# prepare bundles
$ npm run bundle

# format the code using prettier
$ npm run prettier

# auto-generate changelog
$ npm run changelog
```

There are some other scripts available in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.
