        "description": "# About\n Bot API allows bots to interact with TamTam. Methods are called by sending HTTPS requests to botapi.tamtam.chat domain.\n Bots are third-party applications that use TamTam features. A bot can legitimately take part in a conversation. It can be achieved through HTTP requests to the TamTam Bot API.\n## Features\nTamTam bots of the current version are able to:\n- Communicate with users and respond to requests\n- Recommend users complete actions via programmed buttons\n- Request personal data from users (name, short reference, phone number)\n- more ?\n\nWe'll keep working on expanding bot capabilities in the future.\n## Examples\nBots can be used for following purposes:\n- Providing support, answering frequently asked questions\n- Sending typical information\n- Voting\n- Likes/dislikes\n- Following external links\n- Forwarding a user to a chat/channel\n## @PrimeBot\nWe are beta testing bots in TamTam now. To become a beta tester, please, contact us on **https://tt.me/support** or team@tamtam.chat. We'll give you an access to PrimeBot, all TamTam bots creator. It will help you choose an unique short name for a bot and fill in its full name and description. With PrimeBot you can create bots as well as edit and delete them and browse information on bots you have created.\n#### [PrimeBot](https://tt.me/primebot) commands:\n`/start` &mdash; start a dialog with a bot<br/>\n`/create` &mdash; create a bot, assign the unique short name to it (from 4 to 64 characters)<br/>\n`/set_name [name]` &mdash; assign a short or full name to the bot (up to 200 characters)<br/>\n`/set_description [description]` &mdash; enter the description for the bot profile (up to 400 characters)<br/>\n`/set_picture [URL]` &mdash; enter the URL of bot's picture<br/>\n`/delete [username]` &mdash; delete the bot<br/>\n`/list` &mdash; show the list of all bots<br/>\n`/get_token` &mdash; obtain a token for a bot<br/>\n`/revoke` &mdash; request a new token<br/>\n`/help` &mdash; help<br/>\n## Authentification\nA token is given to you by PrimeBot after you have created a bot. You can request additional tokens by sending a /token command to PrimeBot.\nIf [Terms and Conditions of TamTam usage](https://team.tamtam.chat/en/terms/) have been violated, the TamTam administration may withdraw tokens by aborting user sessions.\nIf your token has been compromised, you can request a new one by sending a /revoke command to **[PrimeBot](https://tt.me/primebot)**.\nIn all subsequent requests to the Bot API, you must pass the received token as an access_token parameter to the HTTP request.\n##  HTTP verbs\n`GET` &mdash; getting resources, parameters are transmitted via URL<br/>\n`POST` &mdash; creation of resources (for example, sending new messages)<br/>\n`PUT` &mdash; editing resources<br/>\n`DELETE` &mdash; deleting resources<br/>\n## HTTP response codes\n`200` &mdash; successful operation<br/>\n`400` &mdash; invalid request<br/>\n`401` &mdash; authentication error<br/>\n`404` &mdash; resource not found<br/>\n`405` &mdash; method not allowed<br/>\n`429` &mdash; the number of requests is exceeded<br/>\n`503` &mdash; service unavailable<br/>\n## Resources format\nFor content requests (PUT and POST) and responses, the API uses the JSON format.\nAll strings are UTF-8 encoded.\nDate/time fields are represented as the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00 January 1, 1970 in the long format. To get it, you can simply multiply the UNIX timestamp by 1000. All date / time fields have a UTC timezone.\n## Error responses\nIn case of an error, the API returns a response with the corresponding HTTP code and JSON with the following fields:\n<br/>\n`error` - the string with the error key <br/>\n`message` - a string describing the error </br>\nFor example:\n```bash\n> http https://botapi.tamtam.chat/chats?access_token={EXAMPLE_TOKEN}\nHTTP / 1.1 403 Forbidden\nCache-Control: no-cache\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Length: 57\nContent-Type: application / json; charset = utf-8\nSet-Cookie: web_ui_lang = ru; Path = /; Domain = .tamtam.chat; Expires = 2019-03-24T11: 45: 36.500Z\n{\n   \"error\": \"verify.token\",\n   \"message\": \"Invalid access_token\"\n}\n```\n## Recieving Notifications\nTamTam Bot API supports 2 options of receiving notifications on new dialog events for bots:\n- Push notifications via WebHook. You'll have to use the /subscribe method;\n- Notifications upon request via long polling\nAll data can be received via long polling by default after creating the bot. To receive data via WebHook, you'll have to subscribe explicitly (/subscribe method).\nBoth methods cannot be used simultaneously.\n## Message buttons\nYou can program buttons for users answering a bot.\nTamTam supports the following types of buttons: <br/>\n`callback` &mdash; sends a notification to a bot (via WebHook or long polling) <br/>\n`link` &mdash; makes a user to follow a link <br/>\n`message` &mdash; sends a pre-formed message to the bot as a regular text message <br/>\n`request_contact` &mdash; requests the user permission to access contact information (phone number, short link, email) <br/>\nYou may also send a message with an [InlineKeyboard]() type attachment to start creating buttons. When the user presses a button, the bot receives the answer with filled callback field. It is recommended to edit that message so the user can receive updated buttons.\n"

If a `Content-Type`: multipart/form-data header is passed in a request our service indicates upload type as a simple single request upload. \nThis type of an upload has some restrictions: \n- Max. file size - 2 Gb\u2028\n- Only one file per request can be uploaded\n- No possibility to restart stopped / failed upload\n\n##### Resumable upload\nIf `Content-Type` header value is not equal to `multipart/form-data` our service indicated upload type as a resumable upload.\nWith a `Content-Range` header current file chunk range and complete file size can be passed. If a network error has happened or upload was stopped you can continue to upload a file from the last successfully uploaded file chunk. You can request the last known byte of uploaded file from server and continue to upload a file. \n\n##### Get upload status\nTo GET an upload status you simply need to perform HTTP-GET request to a file upload URL. Our service will respond with current upload status, complete file size and last known uploaded byte. This data can be used to complete stopped upload if something went wrong. If `REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE` or `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` status was returned it is a good point to try to restart an upload",
