# How to use the Redocly CLI

With Redocly CLI, you can bundle your OpenAPI definition and API documentation
(made with Redoc) into a zero-dependency HTML file and render it locally.

## Step 1 - Install Redocly CLI

First, you need to install the `@redocly/cli` package. 

You can install it [globally](/docs/cli/installation.md#global-installation) using npm or Yarn. 

Or you can install it during [runtime](/docs/cli/installation.md#runtime-installation) using npx or Docker.

## Step 2 - Build the HTML file

The Redocly CLI `build-docs` command builds Redoc into a zero-dependency HTML file.

To build a zero-dependency HTML file using Redocly CLI, enter the following command,
replacing `apis/openapi.yaml` with your API definition file's name and path:

```bash
redocly build-docs apis/openapi.yaml
```

See the [build-docs](../../cli/commands/build-docs.md) documentation for more information
on the different options and ways you can use the command.

Also, check out [Redocly CLI commands](../../cli/commands/index.md), for more
information on the different things you can do with Redocly CLI including
linting, splitting, and bundling your API definition file.
